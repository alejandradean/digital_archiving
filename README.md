# digital_archiving
Total beginner here. Sharing some basic Python 3 scripts I've used to manage electronic records and large amounts of data. A lot of what I've written could be improved upon, so please feel free to suggest changes if you see places where code could be simplified or made better. I'm learning as I go and could use feedback!
